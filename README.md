# TravelBuddy
I've created a simple travel application that includes:

A clean, responsive design with a search header
A search form with destination, date, and number of travelers
Destination cards displaying:

*Image

*Location name

*Description

*Price



The application features:

Responsive grid layout that adjusts to screen size
Live search filtering of destinations
Modern card-based UI with smooth shadows and transitions
Clean, organized CSS using modern practices

we can run this directly in a browser, and it includes some sample destination data that we can easily modify or expand.
